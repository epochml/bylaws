## ยง3. New User Requirements
* Any new user who applies to use the Epoch cluster
must be in good standing with IMSA administration and the community, 
unless an exception is made by the Board with a super-majority vote. 
This exception shall be made on a case-to-case basis. 

## ยง4. New User Process
* Any new user must fill out the Epoch Account Request Form, sign it, and submit it to the CTO or CSO.
  * Main board and shadow board members are exempt from this requirement, as their

  * The Epoch Account Request Form shall contain the phrase "
  By signing this form, I certify that I have read the Epoch Slurm Cluster Usage Policies 
  (available at https://goepoch.ml/slurmguidelines) and agree to abide by them." 
  The link for the usage policy may be updated as neccessary at the discretion of the CTO and/or CSO.
* The CTO and CSO (or their designees) shall, at their sole discretion, determine whether the application is accepted or denied. 
* If the application is denied, the reason for the denial shall be documented and provided to the applicant.
* If the application is accepted, a member of the Epoch Technical Team shall notify the applicant and 
issue the applicant's credentials.
