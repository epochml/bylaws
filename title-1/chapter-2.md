## §2. Use of purchased items or services

Any items or services purchased by Epoch must be used only for Epoch purposes and in accordance with IMSA and state policies.

## §3. Purchasing Process

Before any purchases are made, a purchasee (an Epoch member who wants to purchase an item) must first get the purchase approved by the leader of 
their management division. If this approval is not granted, the purchase shall not occur. 

The leader of the management division must then submit a completed version of the Epoch requisition form to the Epoch CEO or the Epoch CFO.
The Epoch CEO or the Epoch CFO must approve this purchase. If this approval is not granted, the purchase shall not occur.

If this approval is granted, the Epoch CFO, Epoch CEO, or the management division leader must meet with the Epoch Staff Advisor to get the Staff Advisor's approval.
If the Epoch Staff Advisor does not grant this approval, the purchase shall not occur.

If the Epoch Staff Advisor does grant this approval, the Epoch Staff Advisor will execute the purchase or will contact the neccessary persons to execute the purchase.
