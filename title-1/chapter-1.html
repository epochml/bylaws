<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in the IETF’s RFC 2119,
excluding the changes made in RFC 8174 (both UPPERCASE and lowercase
usage of the key words have the defined special meanings).</p></li>
<li><p>The term “SUPERMAJORITY” is defined as 60% of the allocated votes.
If there are no class representatives and the Vice President also holds
another position, this would be 5 votes, which is equal to 5 members
of the Board. In the case that there are board positions which are
unfilled, the supermajority is 60% of the allocated votes which
are allocated to filled positions.</p></li>

<li><p>Relations Division’s main purpose shall be to conduct interactions
with other groups within IMSA, including administration and other
student groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Business Division’s main purpose shall be to raise funds and to
conduct relations with individuals and groups outside IMSA.</p></li>
<li><p>Each Division must be allowed to operate with a high level of
autonomy when working toward their goals, and must be able to adopt
their own bylaws and policies as long as they are compatible with
this document.</p></li>
<li><p>Within this document, some rules may be designed to interact with a
Division’s bylaws, and shall have no effect until that Division
adopts the implementing bylaws.</p></li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Membership shall be open to all members of the IMSA community who
have a interest in the computational and data sciences.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Recruitment programs shall be created that emphasize recruitment
and retention of students from culturally, linguistically, and economically
diverse populations, as well as historically marginalized populations
in technical fields.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Members must be in good standing with IMSA administration and the
community, unless an exception is made by the Board with a
super-majority vote. This exception shall be made on a case-to-case
basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Membership shall be granted through request at any meeting, via
email, or through joining the Epoch chat server.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>While this chat server is currently on the Discord platform,
this platform may be changed in the future. In the event that it
is, the Board shall notify members through by broadcasting a
Notice of Platform Change to all members of the previous chat
platform, and provide a minimum one week transition period
before the previous chat platform may be considered deprecated.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Epoch must have a Board of Directors (“Board”), consisting of a
Chief Executive Officer (CEO), a Chief Technical Officer (CTO), a
Chief Systems Officer (CSO), a Chief
Relations Officer (CRO), a Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and a Vice
President / Shadow CEO (sCEO).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>While the Board is only defined as the Main Board and does not
include Shadow Board members, the Main Board members may choose
to involve their shadows in Board actions.</p></li>
<li><p>This Board should consist of members from diverse and historically
marginalized backgrounds.</p></li>
<li><p>No member of the board may hold multiple positions, except that the
Vice President may hold up to 1 other position. If the Vice President
holds another position the role of Vice President is allocated 0 votes.
If the Vice President does not hold another president the CEO is
allocated 0.75 vote and the Vice President is allocated 0.25 vote.</p></li>
<li><p>If the board deems it necessary, it may include any of the following
as additional positions on the board, and may choose to allocate to
each of the following positions either no vote, 0.25 vote, or 1 vote.
In any case, the following positions if they exist may additionally hold
another seat on the board but if they do so their role will be allocated
0 votes.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Sophomore Representative, who must be a sophomore</p></li>
<li><p>Junior Representative, who must be a junior</p></li>
<li><p>Senior Representative, who must be a senior</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The following definitions of alternate names of Board members apply
whenever the following terms are used. They have been adopted for
convenience when interacting with other clubs and StudCo, which
prefer these terms, and for historical reasons.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The term “President” shall be equivalent to CEO.</p></li>
<li><p>The term “Vice President” shall be equivalent to Shadow CEO.</p></li>
<li><p>The term “Treasurer” shall be equivalent to CFO.</p></li>
<li><p>The term “Cluster team head” shall be equivalent to CTO and CSO.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The CTO and CSO shall be affiliated with the Technical
Division, the CRO shall be affiliated with the Relations
Division, and the CFO shall be affiliated with the Business
Division. The CEO, as head of Epoch, must be unaffiliated with any
subdivision.</p></li>
<li><p>The officers who are affiliated with a division shall be in charge
of leading that division.</p></li>
<li><p>The Sophomore, Junior, and Senior Representatives are responsible for
advocating for the students of their class, including those not
currently interested in Epoch, for reporting to the Board the views
of students of their class, and for advocating for the students of
any classes for which representatives have not been chosen. They may
be affiliated with one or more divisions, and may or may not be part
of that division’s leadership.</p></li>
<li><p>Each officer on the Board must choose a Shadow by the end of the
first quarter. This Shadow need not be somebody highly qualified in
the field, but somebody who is willing to learn the necessary
information. Enthusiasm and consistency should be rewarded.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Extensions may be granted by a supermajority vote of the Board.</p></li>
<li><p>Shadows may be current members of the board in other positions,
but this is not recommended except for the Shadow CEO / Vice President
and the Shadow Junior and Senior Representative.</p></li>
<li><p>The Sophomore Representative is not permitted to choose a Shadow,
as such a Shadow would have to be a freshman and IMSA does not
admit freshmen.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Shadows shall be appointed by the Board officer with the advice and
consent of the full Board and the Officer’s division. The Shadow CEO
shall be chosen by the current CEO and be certified by a vote of all
active Epoch student members. A Shadow must be a Sophomore or Junior
when they are instated.</p></li>
<li><p>If a officer of the Board leaves Epoch (or graduates from IMSA),
that officer’s Shadow shall take over his/her role if the officer’s
Division provides a successful vote of confidence in the Shadow, or
in the case of the CEO, a successful vote from all active Epoch
Board and Shadow Board members. In the case that the vote fails, a
new member shall be chosen by the Board and the voting process shall
repeat.</p></li>
<li><p>In Epoch Board meetings, each division shall have an assigned number
of votes. The Technical division shall have two (2) votes, with
each of the CTO and CSO allocated one (1) vote. The business
team shall have one (1) vote, with the CFO allocated one (1) vote.
The relations team shall have one (1) vote, with the CRO assigned one (1) vote.
The CEO shall have one (1) vote. In the event that a Board position cannot be filled,
the remaining votes must be split evenly among the members of the division.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>In the event of a tie, the decision with the vote of the senior
officer in that division shall break the tie. Extend this
concurrently to the shadow Board of that division and finally,
the CEO.</p></li>
<li><p>See §4.4.3 and §4.4.4 for the votes of the class representatives
and of the Vice President</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The Board must have the funding, resources and authority appropriate
to discharge its responsibilities, and shall, as it deems
appropriate and at the expense of Epoch, engage and obtain advice
and assistance from outside advisors.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="meetings">
<h2>§5. Meetings<a class="headerlink" href="#meetings" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Epoch must hold a general meeting at least once every two weeks
during the school year, with an agenda agreed upon beforehand by the
Board of Directors. This time can be revised at any point in the
year. Meetings shall take place on the IMSA campus or via a digital
platform, in areas accessible to all students.</p></li>
<li><p>Epoch general meetings shall be announced at least 48 hours in
advance, and notice of meetings and any record thereof shall be
posted to the Epoch chatroom and website.</p></li>
<li><p>Divisions may choose to have meetings whenever they choose in places
accessible to all members of that Division.</p></li>
<li><p>Epoch Board or the leadership of a Division may choose to hold a
closed meeting to discuss on sensitive topics. It is expected that
if a meeting is closed to an officer or shadow officer, that officer
should not directly join the meeting. However, this does not bar
them from asking questions.</p></li>

<section id="subcommittees-subteams-and-classes">
<h2>§6. Subcommittees, Subteams, and Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#subcommittees-subteams-and-classes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The Board may authorize subteams or subcommittees for any purpose
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>For the purpose of educating and training Epoch members and
facilitating discussion and research, Epoch members may create
classes in fields pertinent to Epoch operations with Board approval.
The Board may invite guest lecturers. These classes shall be
supervised and coordinated by those with extensive knowledge in the
field.</p></li>
<li><p>Project teams, subcommittees, and classes may request funds and
materials from the Business Division. Purchase requests shall follow the
policy set forth in Title 1, Chapter 2 of the Epoch bylaws.</p></li>
<li><p>Subteams and subcommittees may operate under their own charters,
provided that they do not conflict with this document.</p></li>
<li><p>Subteams and subcommittees may add their own advisors which may not
necessarily be Epoch advisors.</p></li>
<li><p>On receiving their respective charters, subteams, subcommittees and
classes shall be considered part of no Division, but they may
petition to join a Division, in which case the petition may be approved
or rejected by the Division’s leadership.</p></li>
<li><p>At least once per semester, Epoch shall hold a meeting with Board,
the heads of each subteam or subcommittee, and those responsible for
running classes.</p></li>
<li><p>As the Education through Competition subteam, the Titan Scouting subteam,
and the AI in Medicine subteam no longer exist, Epoch does not recognize
preexisting agreements with said subteams.</p></li>

<section id="procedure-and-ethics">
<h2>§7. Procedure and Ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#procedure-and-ethics" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The CEO (or their designeee) shall chair all Board meetings.</p></li>
<li><p>The supermajority of the Board members shall constitute a quorum for
transacting official Board business. When members are unable to be
physically present, they may fully participate by teleconference.
The technology must enable Board members to hear the other member(s)
not physically present and enable the member(s) not physically
present to hear the Board discussion.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Rulings passed without quorum are null and void.</p></li>

</li>
<li><p>Board meetings shall follow a predetermined agenda, if one exists,
with the Board having the ability to add and remove items if needed.</p></li>
<li><p>The Board shall not pass any ex post facto rulings.</p></li>
<li><p>Due process shall be followed in all proceedings.</p></li>
<li><p>Disputes within a Division shall be handled within that Division
based on the Division’s policies. If the dispute is between two
members of different Division, or if the dispute is within a
Division and the Division is not able to handle the dispute internally,
a Board or Shadow Board officer from the unaffected Division or an
unaffiliated Board or Shadow Board officer shall mediate. The CEO
should often take this position as an impartial party.</p></li>
<li><p>Board officers may take a sabbatical (where their Shadow or another
designated Epoch member temporarily assumes their position) or
resign their positions by writing a letter to the CEO. If an officer
resigns, they may not apply to be reinstated until four weeks after
the date which their resignation letter takes effect.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Board loses trust in an officer, they can pass a motion of no
confidence (the text of the motion including “this body has no
confidence in [name] fulfilling [his/her/their] duties as
[position]”) with a formal Board vote to remove the officer from
their position.</p></li>
<li><p>All Epoch members shall follow all Epoch, IMSA, state, and federal
rules, regulations, and laws when representing Epoch and shall hold
themselves to a high moral standard. The Epoch Board may open
investigations into any events involving Epoch that do not follow
these standards.</p></li>
<li><p>Any formal Board vote must pass with a supermajority among the
Board.</p></li>
<li><p>To open an investigation, Board shall pass a resolution outlining
the scope of the investigation and appointing someone to build the
case against those investigated.</p></li>
<li><p>Those investigated shall have the right to be informed of nature of
the investigation, to review all evidence and confront all witnesses
against him/her and to introduce his/her own evidence and witnesses,
to obtain counsel within Epoch, to not bear witness against
himself/herself, and not to be investigated twice for the same
charges.</p></li>
<li><p>For each investigation, a panel of two Board or Shadow Board members
and one non-Board individual (potential panel members may recuse
themselves) shall decide on the guilt and punishment of those
accused. Punishments may range from a formal censure to a removal
and ban from Epoch. In extreme cases, the results of an
investigation and any evidence used may be forwarded to IMSA formal
disciplinary officers. The outcomes of each case shall serve as
precedence for future cases.</p></li>
<li><p>If the panel decides on a guilty ruling against a Board member, it
may also recommend his/her removal on ethics. If such a
recommendation is made, the Board shall vote on it at its next
meeting and a majority vote shall result on the member’s removal.</p></li>
<li><p>All non-confidential materials of an investigation shall be made
available to Epoch members upon request.</p></li>

<h2>§9. System Administrators and the Cluster<a class="headerlink" href="#system-administrators-and-the-cluster" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>As the construction of a secure student-run cluster is necessary to
fulfill Epoch’s purpose, the Technical Division shall set up a
training and certification program for cluster hardware technicians
and system administrators (sysadmins). These training and
certification programs shall correspond with various professional
certifications that are issued in the IT industry.</p></li>
<li><p>The officers leading the Technical Division (CSO, CTO) shall be
assigned the role of lead sysadmin and must thus be in charge of
holding cluster root credentials.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Main Board members may choose to extend this designation to
their shadows.</p></li>
<li><p>The Technical Division may choose to extend this designation to
other technical division members, contingent on the consent of a
supermajority of the officers leading the Technical Division.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Head sysadmins may send out communications to whoever it may concern
dictating current technical objectives and what is needed to fulfill
them. When the cluster is undergoing development, expansion, or
upgrade, these communications must occur at least biweekly.</p></li>
<li><p>Head sysadmins are in charge of managing credentials, and thus may
certify other members of Technical Division to hold admin access to
some systems and manage their permissions.</p></li>
<li><p>Since much trust must be placed in sysadmins and they have the power
to cause extreme harm to Epoch in unique ways, Technical Division
shall implement vetting processes of those holding admin access, and
both Technical Division and Board have the power to recall a system
administrator’s access privileges (including a head sysadmin) with a
formal vote.</p></li>
<li><p>Technical Division is in charge of distributing cluster access
credentials and managing access. While the cluster is intended to be
open for all who need it, head sysadmins may deny a potential user
credentials if they deem that the user poses a security or ethics
risk. These denials shall be documented.</p></li>
<li><p>Head sysadmins may revoke credentials whenever deemed necessary.
These revokals shall be documented.</p></li>
<li><p>Technical Division may restrict higher-risk aspects of the cluster
and create systems to decide which members may gain access to those
parts.</p></li>
<li><p>Technical Division may create policies regarding the usage of the
cluster.</p></li>
<li><p>Technical Division may open ethics investigations as described in
Section 6 into potential misuse of the cluster or security breaches.</p></li>
<li><p>The enumeration of powers within this section shall not be
interpreted to limit Technical Division’s or its members’ powers to
build, configure, manage, and secure the cluster.</p></li>
