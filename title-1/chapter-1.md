# Title 1, Chapter 1 - General Provisions

## §1. Definition of Terms


1.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in the IETF's RFC 2119,
    excluding the changes made in RFC 8174 (both UPPERCASE and lowercase
    usage of the key words have the defined special meanings).

## §2. Purpose


1.  The purpose of Epoch is to create a student-run cluster for the
    education of Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (\"IMSA\")
    students in machine learning and other computationally intensive
    fields.

## §3. Management Divisions

1.  Epoch must consist of three Management Divisions: Technical,
    Relations, and Business.

2.  Technical Division's main purpose shall be to build, configure,
    manage, and secure the cluster.

3.  Relations Division's main purpose shall be to conduct interactions
    with other groups within IMSA, including administration and other
    student groups.

4.  Business Division's main purpose shall be to raise funds and to
    conduct relations with individuals and groups outside IMSA.

5.  Each Division must be allowed to operate with a high level of
    autonomy when working toward their goals, and must be able to adopt
    their own bylaws and policies as long as they are compatible with
    this document.

6.  Within this document, some rules may be designed to interact with a
    Division's bylaws, and shall have no effect until that Division
    adopts the implementing bylaws.

7.  The enumeration of purposes within this section shall not be
    construed to limit a Division's goals and abilities.

8.  The enumeration of purposes within this section shall not be
    construed to limit Epoch's goals and abilities. Additionally,
    elements of Epoch may be unaffiliated with *any* of the Epoch
    Management Divisions.

## §4. Membership and Board Structure


1.  Membership shall be open to all members of the IMSA community who
    have a interest in the computational and data sciences.

2.  Members must be in good standing with IMSA administration and the
    community, unless an exception is made by the Board with a
    super-majority vote. This exception shall be made on a case-to-case
    basis.

3.  Membership shall be granted through request at any meeting, via
    email, or through joining the Epoch chat server.

    1.  While this chat server is currently on the Discord platform,
        this platform may be changed in the future. In the event that it
        is, the Board shall notify members through by broadcasting a
        Notice of Platform Change to all members of the previous chat
        platform, and provide a minimum one week transition period
        before the previous chat platform may be considered deprecated.

4.  Epoch must have a Board of Directors (\"Board\"), consisting of a
    Chief Executive Officer (CEO), a Chief Technical Officer (CTO), a
    Chief Systems Officer (CSO), a Chief
    Relations Officer (CRO), and a Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

    1.  While the Board is only defined as the Main Board and does not
        include Shadow Board members, the Main Board members may choose
        to involve their shadows in Board actions.

5.  The CTO and CSO shall be affiliated with the Technical
    Division, the CRO shall be affiliated with the Relations
    Division, and the CFO shall be affiliated with the Business
    Division. The CEO, as head of Epoch, must be unaffiliated with any
    subdivision. 

6.  The officers who are affiliated with a division shall be in charge
    of leading that division.

7.  Each officer on the Board must choose a Shadow by the end of the
    first quarter. This Shadow need not be somebody highly qualified in
    the field, but somebody who is willing to learn the necessary
    information. Enthusiasm and consistency should be rewarded.

    1.  Extensions may be granted by a supermajority vote of the Board.

8.  Shadow board members shall be selected by the respective Board officer and
    certified by a vote of the Board, as well as the Officer's division. 
    The Shadow CEO shall be chosen by the current CEO and be certified by a vote
    of all active Epoch student members. A Shadow must be a Sophomore or Junior
    when they are instated.

9.  If a officer of the Board leaves Epoch (or graduates from IMSA),
    that officer's Shadow shall take over his/her role if the officer's
    Division provides a successful vote of confidence in the Shadow, or
    in the case of the CEO, a successful vote from all active Epoch
    Board and Shadow Board members. In the case that the vote fails, a
    new member shall be chosen by the Board and the voting process shall
    repeat.

10. In Epoch Board meetings, each division shall have an assigned number
    of votes. The Technical division shall have two (2) votes, with
    each of the CTO and CSO allocated one (1) vote. The business
    team shall have one (1) vote, with the CFO allocated one (1) vote.
    The relations team shall have one (1) vote, with the CRO assigned one (1) vote. 
    The CEO shall have one (1) vote. In the event that a Board position cannot be filled, 
    the remaining votes must be split evenly among the members of the division.

    1.  In the event of a tie, the decision with the vote of the senior
        officer in that division shall break the tie. Extend this
        concurrently to the shadow Board of that division and finally,
        the CEO.

11. The Board must have the funding, resources and authority appropriate
    to discharge its responsibilities, and shall, as it deems
    appropriate and at the expense of Epoch, engage and obtain advice
    and assistance from outside advisors.

## §5. Meetings

1.  Epoch must hold a general meeting at least once every two weeks
    during the school year, with an agenda agreed upon beforehand by the
    Board of Directors. This time can be revised at any point in the
    year. Meetings shall take place on the IMSA campus or via a digital
    platform, in areas accessible to all students.

2.  Epoch general meetings shall be announced at least 48 hours in
    advance, and notice of meetings and any record thereof shall be
    posted to the Epoch chatroom and website.

3.  Divisions may choose to have meetings whenever they choose in places
    accessible to all members of that Division.

4.  Epoch Board or the leadership of a Division may choose to hold a
    closed meeting to discuss on sensitive topics. It is expected that
    if a meeting is closed to an officer or shadow officer, that officer
    should not directly join the meeting. However, this does not bar
    them from asking questions.

## §6. Subcommittees, Subteams, and Classes

1.  The Board may authorize subteams or subcommittees for any purpose
    necessary.

2.  For the purpose of educating and training Epoch members and
    facilitating discussion and research, Epoch members may create
    classes in fields pertinent to Epoch operations with Board approval.
    The Board may invite guest lecturers. These classes shall be
    supervised and coordinated by those with extensive knowledge in the
    field.

3.  Project teams, subcommittees, and classes may request funds and
    materials from the Business Division. Purchase requests shall follow the 
    policy set forth in TItle 1, Chapter 2 of the Epoch bylaws.

4.  Subteams and subcommittees may operate under their own charters,
    provided that they do not conflict with this document.

5.  Subteams and subcommittees may add their own advisors which may not
    necessarily be Epoch advisors.

6.  On receiving their respective charters, subteams, subcommittees and
    classes shall be considered part of no Division, but they may
    petition to join a Division.

7.  At least once per semester, Epoch shall hold a meeting with Board,
    the heads of each subteam or subcommittee, and those responsible for
    running classes.

8.  Epoch recognises pre-existing agreements with the Education through
    Competition subteam, the Titan Scouting subteam, and the AI in
    Medicine subteam.

## §7. Procedure and Ethics

1.  The CEO (or their designeee) shall chair all Board meetings.

2.  The supermajority of the Board members shall constitute a quorum for
    transacting official Board business. When members are unable to be
    physically present, they may fully participate by teleconference.
    The technology must enable Board members to hear the other member(s)
    not physically present and enable the member(s) not physically
    present to hear the Board discussion.

    -   Rulings passed without quorum are null and void.

3.  Board meetings shall follow a predetermined agenda, if one exists,
    with the Board having the ability to add and remove items if needed.

4.  The Board shall not pass any ex post facto rulings.

5.  Due process shall be followed in all proceedings.

6.  Disputes within a Division shall be handled within that Division
    based on the Division's policies. If the dispute is between two
    members of different Division, a Board or Shadow Board officer from
    the unaffected Division or an unaffiliated Board or Shadow Board
    officer shall mediate. The CEO should often take this position as an
    impartial party.

7.  Board officers may take a sabbatical (where their Shadow or another
    designated Epoch member temporarily assumes their position) or
    resign their positions by writing a letter to the CEO. If an officer
    resigns, they may not apply to be reinstated until four weeks after
    the date which their resignation letter takes effect.

8.  If the Board loses trust in an officer, they can pass a motion of no
    confidence (the text of the motion including "this body has no
    confidence in \[name\] fulfilling \[his/her/their\] duties as
    \[position\]") with a formal Board vote to remove the officer from
    their position.

9.  All Epoch members shall follow all Epoch, IMSA, state, and federal
    rules, regulations, and laws when representing Epoch and shall hold
    themselves to a high moral standard. The Epoch Board may open
    investigations into any events involving Epoch that do not follow
    these standards.

10. Any formal Board vote must pass with a supermajority among the
    Board.

11. To open an investigation, Board shall pass a resolution outlining
    the scope of the investigation and appointing someone to build the
    case against those investigated.

12. Those investigated shall have the right to be informed of nature of
    the investigation, to review all evidence and confront all witnesses
    against him/her and to introduce his/her own evidence and witnesses,
    to obtain counsel within Epoch, to not bear witness against
    himself/herself, and not to be investigated twice for the same
    charges.

13. For each investigation, a panel of two Board or Shadow Board members
    and one non-Board individual (potential panel members may recuse
    themselves) shall decide on the guilt and punishment of those
    accused. Punishments may range from a formal censure to a removal
    and ban from Epoch. In extreme cases, the results of an
    investigation and any evidence used may be forwarded to IMSA formal
    disciplinary officers. The outcomes of each case shall serve as
    precedence for future cases.

14. If the panel decides on a guilty ruling against a Board member, it
    may also recommend his/her removal on ethics. If such a
    recommendation is made, the Board shall vote on it at its next
    meeting and a majority vote shall result on the member's removal.

15. All non-confidential materials of an investigation shall be made
    available to Epoch members upon request.

## §8. Advisors

1.  Epoch shall seek at least one faculty advisor to provide guidance
    and direction to Epoch members and assist in resolving any disputes.

2.  New advisors that are listed as Epoch advisors to administration
    shall be added with Board approval.

3.  The Technical Division may add official Technical Advisors (which
    are not necessarily Epoch advisors or even within the IMSA
    community) with the consent of the CTO and CSO, shall control the
    application process for this role, and may send out invites to
    apply.

4.  The Business Division may add official Business Mentors (which are
    not necessarily Epoch advisors or even within the IMSA community)
    with the consent of the CEO, shall control the application process
    for this role, and may send out invites to apply.

5.  The Board may approve official Education Advisors, responsible for
    reviewing classes and their curriculum, and providing help if
    necessary.

6.  If needed, the leadership of each Department may give temporary
    supervisor roles to those who hold the proper IMSA clearances.

## §9. System Administrators and the Cluster

1.  As the construction of a secure student-run cluster is necessary to
    fulfill Epoch's purpose, the Technical Division shall set up a
    training and certification program for cluster hardware technicians
    and system administrators (sysadmins). These training and
    certification programs shall correspond with various professional
    certifications that are issued in the IT industry.

2.  The officers leading the Technical Division (CSO, CTO) shall be
    assigned the role of lead sysadmin and must thus be in charge of
    holding cluster root credentials.

    1.  Main Board members may choose to extend this designation to
        their shadows.

    2.  The Technical Division may choose to extend this designation to
        other technical division members, contingent on the consent of a
        supermajority of the officers leading the Technical Division.

3.  Head sysadmins may send out communications to whoever it may concern
    dictating current technical objectives and what is needed to fulfill
    them. When the cluster is undergoing development, expansion, or
    upgrade, these communications must occur at least biweekly.

4.  Head sysadmins are in charge of managing credentials, and thus may
    certify other members of Technical Division to hold admin access to
    some systems and manage their permissions.

5.  Since much trust must be placed in sysadmins and they have the power
    to cause extreme harm to Epoch in unique ways, Technical Division
    shall implement vetting processes of those holding admin access, and
    both Technical Division and Board have the power to recall a system
    administrator's access privileges (including a head sysadmin) with a
    formal vote.

6.  Technical Division is in charge of distributing cluster access
    credentials and managing access. While the cluster is intended to be
    open for all who need it, head sysadmins may deny a potential user
    credentials if they deem that the user poses a security or ethics
    risk. These denials shall be documented.

7.  Head sysadmins may revoke credentials whenever deemed necessary.
    These revokals shall be documented.

8.  Technical Division may restrict higher-risk aspects of the cluster
    and create systems to decide which members may gain access to those
    parts.

9.  Technical Division may create policies regarding the usage of the
    cluster.

10. Technical Division may open ethics investigations as described in
    Section 6 into potential misuse of the cluster or security breaches.

11. The enumeration of powers within this section shall not be
    interpreted to limit Technical Division's or its members' powers to
    build, configure, manage, and secure the cluster.

## §10. Adoption and Amendment

1.  These bylaws have been adopted by Board 1 (CEO JuWon Park, CTO Dev
    Singh, CSO Simone Angelov, CFO Archan Das, CCO Hamza Haq, and CRO
    Sage Owen) on August 5, 2020.

2.  These bylaws may be modified by a super-majority vote of all Board
    officers after a minimum 24-hour consideration period.
