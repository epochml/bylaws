1.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in the IETF's RFC 2119,
    excluding the changes made in RFC 8174 (both UPPERCASE and lowercase
    usage of the key words have the defined special meanings).

## §2. Authority to Enforce
Epoch Bylaws - Title 1, Chapter 1, Section 9

## §3. New User Requirements
* Any new user who applies to use the Epoch cluster
must be in good standing with IMSA administration and the community, 
unless an exception is made by the Board with a super-majority vote. 
This exception shall be made on a case-to-case basis. 

## §4. New User Process
* Any new user must fill out the Epoch Account Request Form, sign it, and submit it to the CTO or CSO.
  * Main board and shadow board members are exempt from this requirement, as their 
  acceptance of the terms outlined in this document is assumed while they maintain their position.
  * The Epoch Account Request Form shall contain the phrase "
  By signing this form, I certify that I have read the Epoch Slurm Cluster Usage Policies 
  (available at https://goepoch.ml/slurmguidelines) and agree to abide by them." 
  The link for the usage policy may be updated as neccessary at the discretion of the CTO and/or CSO.
* The CTO and CSO (or their designees) shall, at their sole discretion, determine whether the application is accepted or denied. 
* If the application is denied, the reason for the denial shall be documented and provided to the applicant.
* If the application is accepted, a member of the Epoch Technical Team shall notify the applicant and 
issue the applicant's credentials.
